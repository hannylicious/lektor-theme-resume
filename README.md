# Lektor Resume

Resume is a simple Lektor theme ported from [startbootstrap](https://startbootstrap.com), which is designed to fit the style of someone who wants a site they can link others to as well as a place to blog about what they're developing in addition to talking about previous projects.

It uses Bootstrap 4, Jquery and Font-Awesome 4 out of the box. It also comes with integration to Google Analytics.

There is a fully functional example-site on the way - but it is not up yet.

This comes with some example/dummy content just to give some idea of what goes where and how everything is laid out.

This theme is under development still - it will probably get further from the original version it was ported from as time goes on.
